First, I created my sql database, but soon I had problems because of the way that I writted it and the functions and methods that I wanted to do, I saw that it didn't worked properly, then I adapted the sql to what I wanted, using previous sql databases and tables that I created for other projects, then I started working on the login page for the user page, I first used bootstrap and the css for his appearence, then I make it function and started to make it more complex, so you couldn't make two identical accounts. After that, I worked then in the book register, in the beggining, it was a little difficult, even more because my xampp failed unexpectedly, but I used other computers to finish the project and managed to link the book and the user just like other projects, and so, it is finished.
